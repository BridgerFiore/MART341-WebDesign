Assignment 3:
1. There are a few advantages to using a text editor. The most advantages is the ease of use during web design. The use of text editors allows the developer to see errors in text more simply than others, and therefore is a quicker method than others.  
2. The main advantage of using a relative url vs an absolute url is, relative urls are shorter than absolute urls because when using a relative url it is only linking two folders that are in the same path. This is also why developers still need absolute urls because those can be directed to any path.
