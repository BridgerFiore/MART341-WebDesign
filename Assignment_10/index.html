    <u><i>Le Tour de France</i></u> is an annual bicylce race primarily held in France. It is the oldest of the three Grand Tours (le Tour de France, la Giro d'Italia (Italy), and la Vuelta a España (Spain)) and is generally considered the most prestigious. Traditionally, the bulk of the race is held in July. While the route changes each year, the format of the race stays the same, and includes time trials, passage through the mountain chains of the Pyrenees and the Alps, and a finish on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.The modern editions of the Tour de France consist of 21 day-long stages over a 23 or 24 day period and cover approximately 3,500 kilometres (2,200 mi) total. The oldest and most sought-after classification in the Tour de France is the general classification. The leader of the GC (general classification) wears the coveted Maillot Jaune (Yellow Jersey).

    <i><h1>The Jerseys:</h1></i>
    <img id="Yellow Jersey" src="Images/Yellow Jersey.jpg" height="300px" alt="Yellow Jersey"

    <p>The symbol of the Tour de France, the yellow jersey, the golden fleece, sponsored by LCL, is worn every day by the leader of the general individual classification and bestowed on the overall winner on the Champs-Élysées. A symbol of excellence, prestige and victory, the yellow jersey is beyond the reach of all but the most well-rounded riders —those who can hold their own on the plains, in the mountains and in time trials.</p>
    <img id="White Jersey" src="Images/White jersey.jpg" height="300px" alt="White Jersey" 
    title="White Jersey" />
    <p>Although the white jersey first appeared in 1968 to reward the leader of the combined classification, which was based on the overall, points and mountains standings, it wasn’t until 1975 that it began to symbolise the future and youth of the Tour de France peloton. A leader in waiting, the wearer of the white jersey, which is sponsored by Krys, is the best placed in the overall standings who is under the age of 26. The Italian Francesco Moser was the first winner of young rider classification and illustrated perfectly its philosophy since he went on to become world champion and the victor of the 1984 Giro, and claimed 10 Classics, including three victories in Paris-Roubaix. Only Laurent Fignon (1983), Jan Ulrich (1997), Alberto Contador (2007), Andy Schleck (2010), Egan Bernal (2019) and Tadej Pogacar (2020) combined the yellow and white jerseys at the final.</p>
    <img id="Green Jersey" src="Images/Green jersey.jpg" height="300px" alt="Green Jersey" 
    title="Green Jersey" />
    <p>Created in 1953 on the occasion of the Tour de France’s 50th anniversary, the green jersey, which is sponsored by Skoda, rewards the rider who is leading the points classification each day. Points are awarded at stage finishes and at the intermediate sprints in line stages. It owes its colour to its first partner, La Belle Jardinière, a chain of clothing stores established in the 19th century. It goes without saying that this symbol of explosivity, passion and speed is typically held by the sprinters. You only have to look at the identity of the winners to be convinced of this, in particular the Slovak Peter Sagan who has won the Green Serge seven times.</p>
    <img id="Polka Dot Jersey" src="Images/Polka dot.jpg" height="300px" alt="Polka Dot Jersey" 
    title="Polka Dot Jersey" />
    <p>Symbol of the mountains, of a rider pushing beyond their limits and of courage, the red polka dot jersey, which is sponsored by E.Leclerc, is awarded to the Tour de France’s leader of the best climber classification. Although this classification was introduced in 1933, its symbol, the polka dot jersey, appeared in 1975, which was also the year the Tour first finished on the Champs-Élysées and was won by Bernard Thévenet. It owes its appearance to track racing specialist Henri Lemoine, who competed between the 1930s and 1950s, and that Félix Lévitan, co-director of the Tour with Jacques Goddetwhich, had particularly noticed. While Belgium’s Lucien Van Impe was its first winner and claimed the mountains classification six times, just like his illustrious predecessor, Spain’s Federico Bahamontes, the so-called “Eagle of Toledo”, Frenchman Richard Virenque holds the record for victories with seven titles.</p>
