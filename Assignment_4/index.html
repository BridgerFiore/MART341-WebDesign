<p>Web browsers are used to display different web pages. To achieve this, a web browser uses an interface to present a web page. The web browser rendering engine is then in charge of presenting the visual aspect of the web page, and not all web browsers use the same rendering engine. The rendering engine takes the HTML and CSS files displaying the interpretation. HTML files are used to markup content and the CSS files are used to style and animate content. The browser engine is used as a mediator between the interface and the rendering engine as well as communication with other servers. The web browser must use the network to obtain all files necessary to display the web page. JavaScript is used to apply interactive logic and functionality. However, all web browsers cannot directly read JavaScript, therefore a JavaScript interpreter is required. Each web browser has its own JavaScript interpreter. Data storage is then used to retain data even when the page is refreshed. Cookies and local storage are examples of data storage. Once all this is performed a render tree can be constructed and then laid out node by node as the page is loading. After the render tree has been successfully applied the web page is presented and ready for interaction.  </p>
<p>DOM is an interface that conducts how a document is accessed and changed by logically defining its structure. The DOM creates a tree structure using the documents as nodes or objects so a programming language can then manipulate the content.  </p>
<p>HTML, XML, and XHTML are types of markup language, however there are some differences between them. HTML is the most common markup language that is the foundation of a web page. Once HTML is established other features can be added. XML complements HTML with the main difference between them is, XML describes nodes and HTML displays nodes. XML is used for sites that require some updates to features without an entire page refresh. XHTML is the bridge between HTML and XML, it was developed as a solution for some HTML shortcomings on small devices. The main difference between XHTML and the others is that it is more precise and therefore easier to maintain. </p>
<p>There are four elements needed for an HTML page: document type, root element, head element, and the body element. The document type goes on the first line and tells the browser engine what type of HTML it is. The root element surrounds all text and elements and defines the HTML elements of the page. Head elements contain high level information about the site itself and comes right after the root element. Finally, the body element is where all information desired to be displayed is located.</p>
<p>index.html files are used as the master HTML for a website. The index.html is located on the homepage, though there can be multiple on one site. The index.html file is used when a browser cannot find a specified file, the browser will ask the host server for the sites index.html file. </p>
<p>There are a few best naming practices when developing a website. First is to always name the homepage as index.html to avoid having to write out the website page and then hyphen the homepage. Another naming practice is to use lowercase letters and no spaces when writing web page code, this will avoid coding and syntax errors. There are a couple other naming practices that are best to follow, another example is do not start a line with a numerical character, like using lowercase this will avoid errors and make writing the webpage easier.   </p>
