<h2>Brief history of Delicate Arch:</h2>
<div class="a">
    <p>People come from all over the world to visit Arches National Park, and visiting Delicate Arch is on the top of many visitors' to-do lists. In a park with over 2,000 stone arches, this particular free-standing arch has become a widely recognized symbol of the state of Utah and one of the most famous geologic features in the world. The light opening beneath the arch is 46 feet high and 32 feet wide, making it the largest free-standing arch in the park. It has had more than a few names in its history, from the colorful ("Cowboy's Chaps", "Old Maid's Bloomers") to the prosaic ("Salt Wash Arch"). The term "Delicate" first appeared in a January 1934 article about the Arches National Monument Scientific Expedition, which described it as "the most delicately chiseled arch in the entire area." </p> </div>
<div class="a">
    <p> It's difficult to see Delicate Arch from the main park road; you must get out of the car to view it. At Lower Delicate Arch Viewpoint, you can walk a level 100 yards (91 m) to see the arch from one mile away. Nearby, the Upper Viewpoint (0.5 mi / 0.8 km walk with stairs) offers a slightly less obstructed view. The trail to see Delicate Arch up close and personal is 3 miles (4.8 km) roundtrip and climbs 480 feet (146m). Along this steadily uphill trail, you'll also pass the Wolfe Ranch cabin and a wall of Ute Tribe petroglyphs</p>
</div>
<br> 
    <h2> Deriections:</h2>
    <p>Drive 11.7 miles north into the park on the main road until you see the right-hand turn to Delicate Arch and Wolfe Ranch. Turn right on Delicate Arch Road and drive another 1.2 miles to the parking area on your left (north). To your right is a lot for oversize vehicles.</p>

    <h2>On the Trail:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To start, the trail climbs over rolling hills before a steep ascent on a slickrock slope with no shade.<i    style="color:mediumslateblue">This hike can get very hot in the summer months,</i> so park officials discourage hiking this trail midday during the summer.</li>
        <li>Once you get over the slickrock climb, the trail levels out. This section puts you among huge sandstone domes, and you will find cairns along the way to mark the trail.</li>
        <li>As you get closer to Delicate Arch, you can see Frame Arch (also known as Twisted Doughnut Arch) to the right</li>
        <li> True to its name, this arch forms a perfect "frame" for a photograph of Delicate Arch</li>
        <li> Further along, the trail follows a ledge that hugs a rock wall for 200 yards</li>
        <li>When you finally come around the corner and see the full breadth of Delicate Arch, you will know why this is such a classic hike.</li>
        <li>You can walk over to the arch and have your photo taken standing under it, but when you are done,<i style="color:mediumslateblue">please move away so others can take pictures.</i></li>
        <li>While the distance is manageable for most people,<i style="color:mediumslateblue">it is more strenuous than a lot of hikers expect.</i></li>
        <li>Be sure to bring along at least <i style="color:mediumslateblue">two quarts</i> of water per person for this trip.</li>
        <li>On the way out or the way back be sure to make the short side trip to see the wall of <i style="color:mediumslateblue">Ute Petroglyphs</i></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>When to Hike Delicate Arch trail:</h2>
    <div class="a">
        <p>Through the spring and fall, the park temperature usually reaches 65 to 85 degrees during the day, with nights as much as 30 degrees cooler. In the summer, daytime temperatures routinely hit 100 degrees, so hikes in the morning and evening are preferable. Make sure to bring along sunscreen and extra water for any summer hike. The trail is open year-round, and in the winter you can take advantage of the near solitude. But be aware, you may need poles or shoe spikes to navigate the trail, which can get icy.</p>
